# PacmanAI
Pacman AI project for UC Berkeley CS188 - Intro to AI

Can access course [here](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html)

This is the latest project of mine that I recently started working on to learn more about the various techniques used in AI. Feel free to clone the project yourself and give it a try! Get started by first switching to the `clean_pacman` branch which is where no project code has been modified. The master branch will have had my latest changes.

## Setting up Environment
This project is completely written in Python 2.7 and doesn't require any additional libraries.

Simply run:
```
git clone https://github.com/bartchr808/PacmanAI
cd PacmanAI
```

## Project Descriptions
### Project_0: Unix/Python/Autograder Tutorial
This is the intro project to get you familiar with how you will interact with the various projects throughout the course.

### Project_1: Search
This project goes over some search algorithms such as bread first, depth first, uniform-cost, and A* search.

### Project_2: Multi-Agent Pac-man
You go over both minimax and expectimax search and write your own evaluation functions your Pac-man will train on.

### Project_3: Reinforcement Learning
This has you implement value iteration and Q-learning.

### Project_4: Ghostbusters
In this project you implement sensors for your Pac-man so it can understand its environment.

### Project_5: Classification
This project touches on behavioural cloning by looking at optical character recognition (OCR) by first creating 3 classifiers:
* Perceptron classifier (on MNIST)
* Large-margin (MIRA) classifier (on MNIST)
* Modified perceptron classifier for behavioural cloning (on Pac-man)

### CaptureTheFlag
As a bonus, in this project, as described on the website, you create a "multi-player capture-the-flag variant of Pacman, where agents control both Pacman and ghosts in coordinated team-based strategies. Your team will try to eat the food on the far side of the map, while defending the food on your home side".

## To Do
Complete projects 0-5 plus the bonus Capture The Flag
